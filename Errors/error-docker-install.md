It seems like you're encountering a common issue with package dependencies. Here's how you can resolve it:

### Step 1: Update the Package List and Fix Dependencies
First, ensure that your package lists are up-to-date, and try to fix any broken dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -f install
```

### Step 2: Manually Install the Dependencies

Since Docker has an unmet dependency on `containerd`, try to install `containerd` manually:

```bash
sudo apt-get install containerd
```

Then try installing Docker again:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```

### Step 3: Use an Alternative Method to Install Docker

If the above steps don't work, you can try installing Docker using the official Docker installation script, which bypasses the default package manager:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

This script installs the latest version of Docker directly from Docker's official repository, which may solve the issue.

### Step 4: Verify Docker Installation

Once installed, verify Docker is running:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker was successfully installed, you can proceed with the Rancher setup.
