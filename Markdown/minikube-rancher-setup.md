# 🚀 How to Set Up Rancher Using Minikube in GitHub Codespaces: A Step-by-Step Guide 🛠️

If you're looking to get Rancher up and running on Minikube in GitHub Codespaces, you've come to the right place! In this guide, I'll walk you through setting it all up, step by step, so you can harness the power of Rancher with Minikube from the convenience of GitHub Codespaces.

Let’s dive right in! 🏊‍♂️

---

## 📝 What You'll Learn:
By the end of this guide, you will be able to:
1. Install Minikube in your GitHub Codespace environment
2. Set up Rancher on top of your Minikube cluster
3. Access the Rancher UI from GitHub Codespaces

---

## Step 1: 🎯 Launch GitHub Codespaces 
To begin, ensure that you have GitHub Codespaces enabled on your repository. If not, go ahead and create one. It’s your cloud development environment where we’ll set everything up.

*(You can click the green "Code" button on your repo and choose "Open with Codespaces")*

---

## Step 2: 🚀 Install Minikube in Codespaces
Minikube allows you to run Kubernetes locally, but here, we'll configure it to run inside the GitHub Codespace.

Start by installing Minikube:

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin/
```

Then, verify the installation:

```bash
minikube version
```

You should see the version information displayed.

---

## Step 3: 🛠️ Start Minikube

Next, we'll start Minikube with Docker as the driver:

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

Minikube will pull the necessary images and start the Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Step 4: 🌟 Install Helm (Optional but Recommended)
Helm makes it easier to install applications in Kubernetes. If you don’t have Helm already installed in your Codespace, install it with:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

You can verify Helm installation using:

```bash
helm version
```

---

## Step 5: 🏗️ Deploy Rancher Using Helm
With Helm and Minikube set up, you can now install Rancher.

1. Add the Rancher Helm chart repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Install Rancher using the following Helm command:

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace cattle-system
   helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher --namespace cattle-system --set hostname=rancher.localhost
   ```

   *This will start Rancher and set it up with the provided hostname.*

---

## Step 6: 🔗 Access Rancher UI

To access the Rancher UI from GitHub Codespaces, you'll need to use port forwarding. Run:

```bash
kubectl -n cattle-system port-forward svc/rancher 8080:80
```

Once it's running, open your Codespace's ports tab and forward port 8080. This will allow you to access Rancher at `localhost:8080` directly within your browser.
