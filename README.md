# 🚀 Rancher on GitHub CodeSpaces

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to set up **Rancher**, a powerful Kubernetes management tool, on **GitHub CodeSpaces**. Rancher allows you to deploy, manage, and scale Kubernetes clusters efficiently, and running it inside GitHub CodeSpaces offers a cloud-based development environment for a seamless workflow.

## ✅ Prerequisites

To follow this guide, ensure you have:

- A **GitHub Account** with **CodeSpaces** enabled.
- Basic knowledge of **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.
- An internet connection to pull the Rancher Docker image.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Clone this repository or start from scratch by initializing a README file.

### 2. Open CodeSpaces

- Click on the **Code** button in GitHub and choose **Open with CodeSpaces**.

### 3. Install Docker in CodeSpaces

In the terminal of CodeSpaces, run the following commands to install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```

Verify Docker installation:

```bash
docker --version
```

### 4. Pull Rancher Docker Image

Run the following command to pull the latest Rancher image:

```bash
docker pull rancher/rancher:latest
```

### 5. Run Rancher

Start the Rancher container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --privileged --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 rancher/rancher
```

### 6. Access Rancher UI

Once Rancher is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost
```

You should see the Rancher login page. Follow the steps to set up Rancher and start managing Kubernetes clusters.

## 🎯 Usage

After setting up Rancher, you can:

- Create or import Kubernetes clusters.
- Manage workloads, networking, and storage from within the Rancher UI.
- Scale clusters up or down as needed.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Docker not installed?** Run `sudo apt-get install -y docker.io` to install it.
- **Rancher container not starting?** Verify you have sufficient memory in your CodeSpaces environment.

For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the Rancher [documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/).
